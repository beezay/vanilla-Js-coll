1. Declare a array 
 [{Id:1,EmployeeName:"Rajesh",Age:22},{Id:2,EmployeeName:"Suman":Age:24},{Id:3,EmployeeName:"Bhuban",Age:28},{Id:4,EmployeeName:"Anamika":Age:32}
  {Id:5,EmployeeName:"Shree",Age:29},{Id:6,EmployeeName:"Marco",Age:23},{Id:7,EmployeeName:"Ganesh",Age:25},{Id:8,EmployeeName:"Dhriti",Age:31}] 
  and iterate through it to return a new array whose name contains a letter 'a' in it.
  (Assign that array in a new array variable)

2. Write a function to check if the provided value is palindrome .(traditional javascript methods, cannot use split,join and all)
3. Write a function to return date in "2020-02-21" format.
4. Create a switch case for ["Bitcoin","DogeCoin","Litecoin","Ethereum","Binance Coin"] array and return their 
   respective price [$52,126,$0.0526,$232.06,$1,909.77,144.048] and name combined array. Example: [{Name:"Bitcoin",Price:"$52"}]

5. Create a regex to test if a string has underscore in between (not in the start and end) and a digit at the end.
6. Create  three different class (Class A, Class B, Class C), Class A has a field FirstName, Class B has a field LastName and
   create a method in Class C to console.log() the concatenate value of firstName from Class A and LastName from Class B.(Use inheritance)
7. Write a function to give me only the array whose name has both the character "a" and "e" and age is greater than 25.(Use array from question 1)
8. Make function in question 7 async function (Value must be returned after certain delay).
